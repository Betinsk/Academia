Position yourself by sitting with your back against the machine, feet flat on the ground, and hands gripping the handles shoulder-width apart, maintaining a straight back and 90-degree elbow angle. Push the handles away from your chest while exhaling, focusing on your chest muscles, and then slowly return to the starting position by bending your elbows. Perform the desired number of controlled repetitions, utilize safety catches if available, and take brief breaks between sets according to your workout plan. Remember to use proper form to prevent injury, start with a lighter weight before progressing, seek guidance from a fitness professional if unsure, and consult a healthcare professional if you have health concerns.',

Keep your back straight, chest up, and elbows at around a 90-degree angle. Lower the barbell to the upper chest while inhaling, then push it back up to the starting position while exhaling. Perform controlled repetitions, ensuring proper form throughout. Set safety catches if available, start with a manageable weight, and gradually progress.

Attach a single handle to each cable, ensuring they are set at the same height on both sides of the machine. Stand in the center of the machine, facing outward, and grasp the handles with palms facing downward. Adopt a staggered stance for stability, keeping a slight bend in your elbows. Initiate the movement by bringing both handles together in front of your body, slightly bending your elbows. Squeeze your chest muscles at the fully contracted position, maintaining an upright posture and engaged core. Slowly and with control, open your arms, returning to the starting position while keeping tension on the cables. Perform the desired number of repetitions, focusing on smooth and controlled movements. Experiment with different angles and heights to target various areas of the chest and shoulders. Breathe out as you bring the handles together and inhale as you return to the starting position. Adjust the weight on the machine to match your fitness level, gradually increasing resistance as needed. Ensure proper form to maximize effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury. Consult with a fitness professional or healthcare provider if you have any health concerns before incorporating new exercises into your routine.',
